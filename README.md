# TherAIpest
Alexa skill that uses NLP and flask-ask to simulate a virtual therapist. Based on the user's sentiment analysis score from talking to the theraipest, the skill redirects to user specific "storylines", creating a personalized user experience. 

Using Python's Nautral Language Toolkit (NLTK), a user's responses undergo sentiment analysis. From there, if the statement is positive then it is met with a positive response, and if it's negative, vice versa. 

# Will commit less frequently over few weeks, touring scandanavia.
