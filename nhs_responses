Peer Tutoring at Hillside Elementary School. For my community service hours required of me in 8th grade, I chose to peer tutor elementary school students who were falling behind in class. I taught them the fundamentals of math (addition, subtraction, etc.) and proper grammar.

I devoted one hour every Monday afterschool for six weeks from February to April to peer tutoring. I would bike from my middle school over to Hillside Elementary right after school to start each tutoring session at 3:00pm.

For my 8th grade community service project, I had chosen to partake in Peer Tutoring for elementary school students who had problems grasping basic, fundamental concepts in Math and English. I had contacted my old school, Hillside Elementary School, about the idea and set up a meeting with the school's principal. After receiving permission from the school's principal, I had made an appointment to meet with a first grader named Madison once a week for six weeks. I decided to bike to school every Monday, so that I could avoid the traffic and chaos of after school pickup and go straight there. On my first Monday, I met the student that I would be tutoring for the first time. Her name was Madison, and although she was kind and sweet upon meeting her, she later turned frustrated when we began to work on math together. Madison would become visibly frustrated whenever I tried to teach her a mental trick or try to explain something to her, because she felt as though she should know all of this stuff by now. Basic addition and subtraction problems became a challenge for her, and it was hard to teach her something that has become so automatic to me. The breakthrough came on our third meting together, when I brought in marbles and visualized each problem from her homework. To many it seemed like a silly idea, but Madison began to thrive after this moment. By our last time meeting, she could add and subtract numbers in her head like it was nothing. This experience taught me that it's very hard to generalize a teaching approach for students, because everyone learns differently. Peer tutoring refines student's skills by focusing in on areas of improvement, and is an important extracurricular method of learning for students.

I had devoted one week to volunteering at one of the camp activities while it was understaffed. I served Monday-Friday, each day consisting of 8 hours of work from 8am to 4pm.

First Lego League (FLL) Mentor. Supervised a middle school robotics team, and offered advice on how to improve their robot to accomplish certain tasks. The robot was made out of legos and a Mindstorm NXT.
